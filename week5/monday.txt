			- npm command in terminal
		- registry
			- database of JS software available for download
	- npm init
		- initializes a new JS project
			- generate the package.json
				- like the pom.xml
				- allows us to list dependencies used
				- allows us to add metadata about the project
	- node_modules
		- folder that contains all of the dependencies required for an npm project
			- after cloning/pulling an npm project, run npm install to download the required dependencies
		- good practice is to add the node_modules folder to a .gitignore
			- otherwise all of the dependencies are also pushed to Github
		- managed by npm
			- add dependency using npm install
			- remove dependency using npm uninstall
	- package-lock.json
		- specifies the exact version of the dependencies and required subdependencies so that the project is 100% reproducible
