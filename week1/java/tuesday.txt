Java
	- Platform independent
		- Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)
			- due to the JVM
	- Mature language
		- Oracle Supported
		- lot of documentation
		- lot of resources
			- Stack Overflow
			- Tutorials
	- Compiled Language
		- Optimization
		- Compile time Error Checking
	- Automatic garbage collection
		- no need to manually allocate and deallocate memory
			- garbage collector
	- Multithreading
		- running processes concurently
	- Strictly type
	- OOP Language
		

JDK/JRE/JVM
	- Java Development Kit
		- Provides an environment to develop and execute a Java Program
		- Contains the compiler (javac), tools for development 
		- Contains the JRE and JVM
	- Java Runtime Environment
		- All that's needed to RUN an application
		- Java core libraries
		- Contains the JVM
	- Java Virtual Machine
		- Takes the compiled code (from the compiler) and executes it from the main method
		- Different OS have different JVM implementation

	- Compilation process:
		- Highlevel code(Java source code) (.java) -> javac [.java file] -> Bytecode (intermediary language) (.class file)
	- Running java
		- Bytecode (intermediary language) (.class file) -> java [name of file, no extension]
