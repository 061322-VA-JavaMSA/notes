Exceptions
	- represent a condition that prevents a method from completing successfully
	- Objects created from the Exception class and its subclasses
		- inherits from the Throwable class
		- divided into checked/unchecked exception
			- checked exceptions
				- "compile time exceptions", code cannot be compiled until the exception is handled
				- either Exception or its subclasses but not a Runtime Exception
				- arise from circumstances outside of the programmer's control
					- ie: FileNotFound, SQLException(from the Database)...
			- unchecked exceptions
				- "runtime exceptions", not checked by the compiler
				- Runtime Exception or its subclasses
				- arise from coding error/ can usually be prevented with a bit of logic

Error
	- also extend from Throwable
	- Identify internal issues that cannot be recovered from
		- bad practice to handle them/try to catch them
		- ie: OutofMemoryError, StackOverflow

Exception Handling
	- try
		- used to encapsulate "risky code"
			- statements that may throw a checked exception
	- catch
		- used handle exception/ provide behavior in order to handle an exception of a specific type
		- can provide multiple catch blocks
			- order from most specific, to least specific or the most generic exception will catch all
	- finally
		- executes regardless of the outcome
			- whether or not an exception is thrown
		- used to close resources
		- way to skip the finally block?
			- System.exit(0);
	- throws
		- used in the method signature to "pass the buck"
		- if there is not enough information to handle an exception properly at the time it's thrown
	- try-with-resources
		- java 8 feature
			- declares and initializes a variable within the try
		- allows a resource to be closed without needing a finally block
		- the resource needs to implement the Autoclosable interface 

Throwing an exception
	- throw new [constructor for exception]();

Custom Exception
	- extends from the relevant exception

Maven
	- Project Management Tool and also a Build Automation Tool
		- handles our dependencies for us
			- dependency: framework/library written by other developer to be used in your project
