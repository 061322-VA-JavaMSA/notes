# Java Compilation Activity:
- Within the "week1" folder in your repository, create another folder called "java-compilation-activity"
- Within that folder create a Java Application that takes in some user input using the String[] args passed into the main method.
	- Depending on the number of input in the array, the application should return different output:
		 - 1 input: get a random number
		 	- [java.lang.Math](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html) has some helpful methods
		 - 2 input(int x, String s): Print out s x amount of times
- Push your Java code and the bytecode resulting from compiling your code to your repository
