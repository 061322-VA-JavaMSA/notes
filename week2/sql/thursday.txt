		- Properties of a transaction: ACID
			- Atomicity
				- one unit, transaction should be completed as a whole or not at all
			- Consistency
				- database should be in a valid state before and after the transaction
					- in regards to database constraints
					- in regards to the business logic
			- Isolation
				- a transaction should not interfere with another transaction
				- results of transactions executing concurently should be the same as if they were executed in sequence
					- Transaction Isolation Levels
			- Durability
				- Commits are final, changes are persisted to the database
